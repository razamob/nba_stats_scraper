# nba_stats_scraper

A web scraper that uses https://stats.nba.com/leaders/ to get stats for the top scorers in the nba. 

All of the stats for all of the categories are scraped. 

The stats are converted into a python dictionary which is then converted to csv file. 

The stats will be analyzed using D3(JavaScript) or Pandas(Python). 

Future implementation may include storing the data in a sqlite database and using that to visualize the data.
